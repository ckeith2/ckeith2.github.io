# How to file Your Taxes while on NSF GRFP

Hello fellow kids/struggling grad students,

I am a graduate student at the university of chicago and had an NSF-GRFP grant from fall 2018 through summer 2021. Due to the nature of the NSF, we are paid in non-taxed, lump sums four times a year. This looks great on my bank statements, but it's much more confusing when it comes to tax time. Because we do not get a W2 for our NSF income, we have to file our income in a separate box, and also make estimated tax payments to avoid fines come tax time. I will try my best to explain how to do this. Since 2021 was my last year on NSF, I have both a regular W2 for my taxes this year that had normal withholding, as well as my NSF tax payments that were not taxed.

Also this is probably obvious but I’m not a tax expert, just someone who has filed her taxes to the best of her ability and had a conversation with tax experts here at UChicago about NSF and estimated tax payments in 2018, when I first moved here. This isn’t meant to be tax advice or whatever, just what I do.

## Estimated Tax Payments

Let's start with the main weird thing you’re going to have to do on NSF: estimated tax payments. We get paid in untaxed, lump sums, but that doesn’t mean that you don’t have to pay taxes on that amount. You make estimated payments to the best of your ability sometime in the year before you owe the taxes (so I made my 2021 estimated payments in 2021, and now they apply to filing in 2022). 

Many websites and places will discuss that you need to pay quarterly, and you can, if you want. But the IRS doesn’t care when you pay or if you pay quarterly, they care that you pay enough by the end of the tax year, which is January 15 (I think) of the following year. For example, in 2021, I paid my estimated taxes for 2021 on December 5th, 2021. I do this as a lump sum, and for reference, when on the $8500/quarter NSF in 2020, I paid about $1500 in state estimated taxes, and $3000 in federal. I did this as a lump sum at some time during the year, but feel free to make more sporadic payments as to not have to remove that much money from your bank accounts at once. It does hurt, not going to lie.

You also do not actually have to make these estimated payments, but you will end up paying extra around tax time if you wait until then to pay any taxes at all. You do not have to be immensely precise, but just approximately correct. When I have time, I may add information on how to make this approximation. However, since state taxes vary widely depending on which state you live in, only federal may be consistent.

The website I use here in Illinois for my estimated tax payments are [here](https://mytax.illinois.gov/_/#0), I then click on “Make an IL-1040, IL-1040-ES, or IL-505-I payment”

You should make an account, save any password information securely, and save a PDF of your estimated payment information. For federal taxes, I use the [IRS's website](https://www.irs.gov/payments). Save your information and your confirmation as well, here. You’ll need it around tax time.

## What to do with a W2

Now that it is tax time, we can use the estimated tax payment information, along with any other tax documents we have, to start filing. I have personally never received any documentation about the total amount the NSF pays me, except for what I see in my bank account. It is important to keep track of how much you get paid, since the NSF and the schools paying us don’t do it for us.

I’m using [Freetaxusa.com](Freetaxusa.com) to file my taxes, but you can use whatever. (Sidenote: grr to lobbying power of tax filing agencies for making sure taxes stay difficult so they can keep charging us for being an unnecessary middleman.)

I have a W2, but <strong>if you don’t you can just skip this stage.</strong>

If you don’t have a W2  because you were paid completely on NSF for a year, you do <strong>not</strong> need to input any income here. Do not include your NSF income on your W2 form when filing. I did not include a screenshot here because filing your W2 is self explanatory. Most tax programs I’ve used have freaked out a little bit when you opt to not include a W2, but it is correct in this instance.

You can also input any other income you might have as prompted. This has nothing to do with NSF but I, for example, had some dividend income that I needed to input:

Input all your regular tax information as usual, including your 1098-T (even though our tuition is covered by our universities)

## NSF Income

Where we get to the NSF stuff is in the ‘other income’ box.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/oJpSMSc.png4" width="600" height="500">

You can see this here. In the previous year, I made ~34000 on NSF (in 2020, when all of my income was from NSF, this year I was on it for half the year). You’ll want to click on this. You’ll see it says “includes taxable scholarship income” which is unfortunately what NSF is. Once inside this option, you’ll want to select “yes” under taxable scholarships or grants. Since we are grad students, you also want to check “yes” for scholarship and fellowship grants from grad or postdoctoral payments. Presumably none of this income was taxed, so we have no federal tax withheld.

In the box, put the total amount you were paid in NSF. For example, if you were paid 8500 four times in 2021, you’d input 34000 in this box.

And that’s it, that’s how you account for your NSF income. My tax program was like “are you sure that this is taxable” but yes, it sadly is. You can also include any other non-taxed income here. For example, my partner had a scholarship that gave him about 5000 every fall. This was also a lump sum, untaxed. He needs to include that in this box as well.


## Federal Estimated Tax Payments

Okay, now that we have reported the untaxed income, we need to report the estimated taxes that we paid. (I took the standard deduction because we don’t get paid enough to do the itemized). The first one that freetaxusa prompts me to input is federal estimated taxes. It even shows me when all the quarterly payments are due. Remember, you just have to have your taxes in by the final due date, you don’t have to make quarterly payments unless making one big lump sum kinda sucks for you.

I paid in December of 2021 for these taxes.

There are boxes for payments made in every quarter. Only input your payments in the box that corresponds to the quarter you paid in. For me, that was December, and I estimated 1600 for the year.

This is why it can be so important to keep a document with all your estimated tax payments on it. I have a tax folder that I know I can look at to get all of this information quickly. This is all you have to do for your federal estimated tax payments.

This is what my income summary looks like.

I can see in my payment summary here, that I have both income tax withheld from my W2 (you may not have this if your only income was NSF), as well as my estimated tax payments that I made.

## State Estimated Tax Payments

State returns are going to be more finicky, but there should be a box to input your estimated payments there as well. This guide is majority for federal taxes, but I’m hoping it won’t be too bad to do your state as well.

## Fin

If anyone has any questions, feel free to reach out to me at ckeith@uchicago.edu. Again, I am not a certified tax expert or whatever, this is all my own experience and opinions. Also, if I have forgotten to censor something I should have censored, pretty please don’t steal my personal information.

I will try to make this a living document and update it as necessary, as well as eventually get it on a real deal website.
